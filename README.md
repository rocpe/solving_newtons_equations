# Program which solves Newton's equations for 1D point mass in given potential
It uses explicit Euler method or trapezoid method. It calculates position x(t),
velocity v(t), energy. "alpha" is resistance coefficient. R script gives nice
plots. You can tweak main.cpp and plots.r so as to get wanted result. You can
change potential in main.cpp file.
# Compilation
Just type "make" in terminal. Type "make plots" to get plots. You need to have
g++ installed.
